# yii2-smart-crud-giinerator
This repo contains modifications to the Yii2 Gii CRUD generator. These modifications allow the generator to generate the foreign key columns of related tables using a meaningful descriptive value of another column. For example: instead of showing the column id for a user table, it shows username while keeping the relationship through the foreign key.
